      <title>An Executable HPKE Specification</title>

      <description>HPKE is published CFRG as RFC 9180 that describes a scheme for hybrid public key encryption.
 ðŸ“š Please go and read our TL;DR on HPKE if you nee more background on HPKE.
 In this I describe the first executable HPKE specification using hacspec. It is not only an executable specification of HPKE, it is also an annotated version of the RFC that can be read instead of (or in addition to) the RFC.</description>

      <title>TL;DR - Hybrid Public Key Encryption</title>

      <description>HPKE is a CFRG in RFC 9180 that describes a scheme for hybrid public key encryption. It is co-authored by my Cryspen co-founder Karthikeyan Bhargavan and one of his PhD students Benjamin Lipp as part of his research at Inria.
This blog post will give a brief overview of the specification and describes some use cases.
If you want to learn more about the security proofs behind HPKE and the RFC process, Benjamin wrote an excellent blog post about it.</description>

      <title>Cryspen ERC PoC Grant</title>

      <description>My co-founder Karthik got awarded an ERC Proof of Concept grant for commercialising the know-how and landmark research results from his Inria research group PROSECCO through Cryspen.
Announcement Cryptographic mechanisms are crucial to the security of our digital lives but their design and implementation remains notoriously difficult and error-prone. With the help of two ERC Grants, Karthikeyan Bhargavan and the Prosecco team at Inria have developed state-of-the-art formal verification techniques that can be applied to real-world cryptographic software.</description>
