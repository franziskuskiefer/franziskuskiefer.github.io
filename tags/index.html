      The Security Engineering University Relationship Framework (SURF) is an initiative within the Firefox security engineering team to improve relations with privacy and security researchers. SURF includes a variety of possible relationships but is focused on building long-term relationships with researchers and organisations. The goal of SURF projects is to explore topics that are outside of Mozilla&rsquo;s immediate product needs, influence Mozilla&rsquo;s long-term product development and vision.
On November 12th the first SURF summit was held in London.

      Writing constant time code is hard. We all know that. But I&rsquo;m always amazed again on how difficult it is. In preparation for making NSS more constant time I looked into certain CPU instructions that are known to be not constant time. So I wrote a little thing to measure the time (CPU cycles) needed for division.

      HacSpec is a proposal for a new specification language for cryptographic primitives that is succinct, that is easy to read and implement, and that lends itself to formal verification.

HacSpec specifications are further executable to test against test vectors specified in a common syntax.
The main focus of HacSpec is to allow specifications to be compiled to formal languages such as cryptol, coq, F*, and easycrypt and thus make it easier to formally verify implementations.

      HacSpec is a proposal for a new specification language for cryptographic primitives that is succinct, that is easy to read and implement, and that lends itself to formal verification. It aims to formalise the pseudocode used in cryptographic standards by proposing a formal syntax that can be checked for simple errors. HacSpec specifications are further executable to test against test vectors specified in a common syntax.
The main focus of HacSpec is to allow specifications to be compiled to formal languages such as cryptol, coq, F*, and easycrypt and thus make it easier to formally verify implementations.

      After a couple of years using ghost I switched to the static page generator hugo. Hugo is easy to write and easy to publish. But more importantly it doesn&rsquo;t offer the attack surface ghost does and doesn&rsquo;t require external ressources like ghost does. It further decreases the amount of ressources used on the server.
