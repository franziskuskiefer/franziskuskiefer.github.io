      I don&rsquo;t like to write a post like this but I really feel that this one is necessary. After not even half a year I&rsquo;m going to leave the Fraunhofer AISEC at the end of May. In this post I want to explain why.
This is not a post about contact tracing!
During the week of April 13 the controversy around PEPP-PT started to heat up. Articles from coindesk and other media such as Golem (German), started to pop up and I started to get a little concerned knowing that AISEC is part of the PEPP-PT organization.

      Last week we had the third Security Engineering University Relationship Framework (SURF) summit in Vienna. The last SURF summit I attended was the first one in London 2018.
This time we had four talks by Mozillians, three invited talks, as well as eight lightning talks. I live-tweeted a little during the event if you like slides on photos.
Christoph talked about how to harden the content security landscape of Firefox and posed the question how we could do some of that on the web.

      The Security Engineering University Relationship Framework (SURF) is an initiative within the Firefox security engineering team to improve relations with privacy and security researchers. SURF includes a variety of possible relationships but is focused on building long-term relationships with researchers and organisations. The goal of SURF projects is to explore topics that are outside of Mozilla&rsquo;s immediate product needs, influence Mozilla&rsquo;s long-term product development and vision.
On November 12th the first SURF summit was held in London.

      Writing constant time code is hard. We all know that. But I&rsquo;m always amazed again on how difficult it is. In preparation for making NSS more constant time I looked into certain CPU instructions that are known to be not constant time.

      One of Rusts great feature is that it catches integer overflows at runtime and panics rather than wraps (in debug builds). I recommend you read Huon&rsquo;s blog post about this from a couple years ago.
While this is a desirable behaviour in general, integer overflows are commonly used when implementing cryptography primitives. Rust offers wrapping alternatives such as wrapping_add etc. to allow wrapping behaviour. However, this makes code very hard to read, e.

In this blog post I&rsquo;ll give the gist of the SSR paper and introduce the first version of hacspec.

      HACL* (High-Assurance Cryptographic Library) is a formally verified cryptographic library in F*, developed by the Prosecco team at INRIA Paris in collaboration with Microsoft Research, as part of Project Everest. HACL* was inspired by discussions at the HACS workshop and aims at developing a set of reference implementations in C for common cryptographic primitives.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      HacSpec is a proposal for a new specification language for cryptographic primitives that is succinct, that is easy to read and implement, and that lends itself to formal verification. It aims to formalise the pseudocode used in cryptographic standards by proposing a formal syntax that can be checked for simple errors. HacSpec specifications are further executable to test against test vectors specified in a common syntax.
The main focus of HacSpec is to allow specifications to be compiled to formal languages such as cryptol, coq, F*, and easycrypt and thus make it easier to formally verify implementations.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      On April 19, 2017, Mozilla Foundation published the Security Advisory 2017-10 outlining several recently fixed security vulnerabilities. One of these vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2017-5462, affects the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) within the Network Security Services (NSS) library prior to version 3.29.5 and Firefox prior to version 53.
This post describes the bug and how it was discovered.
Inside the NSS PRNG NSS uses Hash_DRBG as PRNG, which is one of several PRNG schemes defined in the NIST Special Publication 800-90.

      AES-GCM is a NIST standardised authenticated encryption algorithm (FIPS 800-38D). Since its standardisation in 2008 its usage increased to a point where it is the prevalent encryption used with TLS. With 85% it is by far the most widely used cipher.

      One of Rusts great feature is that it catches integer overflows at runtime and panics rather than wraps (in debug builds). I recommend you read Huon&rsquo;s blog post about this from a couple years ago.
While this is a desirable behaviour in general, integer overflows are commonly used when implementing cryptography primitives. Rust offers wrapping alternatives such as wrapping_add etc. to allow wrapping behaviour. However, this makes code very hard to read, e.

      Last week we had the third Security Engineering University Relationship Framework (SURF) summit in Vienna. The last SURF summit I attended was the first one in London 2018.
This time we had four talks by Mozillians, three invited talks, as well as eight lightning talks. I live-tweeted a little during the event if you like slides on photos.
Christoph talked about how to harden the content security landscape of Firefox and posed the question how we could do some of that on the web.

      The Security Engineering University Relationship Framework (SURF) is an initiative within the Firefox security engineering team to improve relations with privacy and security researchers. SURF includes a variety of possible relationships but is focused on building long-term relationships with researchers and organisations. The goal of SURF projects is to explore topics that are outside of Mozilla&rsquo;s immediate product needs, influence Mozilla&rsquo;s long-term product development and vision.
On November 12th the first SURF summit was held in London.

 HACL* is a cryptographic library written in F* that allows translation to C using kremlin. It guarantees memory safety, secret independent computation, and functional correctness with respect to a mathematical specification.
 In this second blog post I describe the process of integrating code from HACL*, a researchy crypto library, into NSS, a production library shipping to millions of people, running on a plethora of platforms.

When someone says they built their own encryption scheme and message format I get obviously curious.

      HacSpec is a proposal for a new specification language for cryptographic primitives that is succinct, that is easy to read and implement, and that lends itself to formal verification. It aims to formalise the pseudocode used in cryptographic standards by proposing a formal syntax that can be checked for simple errors. HacSpec specifications are further executable to test against test vectors specified in a common syntax.
The main focus of HacSpec is to allow specifications to be compiled to formal languages such as cryptol, coq, F*, and easycrypt and thus make it easier to formally verify implementations.

        Mozilla SURF Summit Vienna 2019

      Last week we had the third Security Engineering University Relationship Framework (SURF) summit in Vienna. The last SURF summit I attended was the first one in London 2018.
This time we had four talks by Mozillians, three invited talks, as well as eight lightning talks. I live-tweeted a little during the event if you like slides on photos.
Christoph talked about how to harden the content security landscape of Firefox and posed the question how we could do some of that on the web.

      The Security Engineering University Relationship Framework (SURF) is an initiative within the Firefox security engineering team to improve relations with privacy and security researchers. SURF includes a variety of possible relationships but is focused on building long-term relationships with researchers and organisations. The goal of SURF projects is to explore topics that are outside of Mozilla&rsquo;s immediate product needs, influence Mozilla&rsquo;s long-term product development and vision.
On November 12th the first SURF summit was held in London.

        Submitting through Editorial Manager

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Today I had to submit a paper through the Editorial Manager (used by Springer) for the first time. Needless to say that it&rsquo;s not as easy as it sounds. Therefore here some helpful links for everyone having to do the same. I ended up putting the references in the .tex file as nothing else worked for me.

      Thanks to Deez I gave web monetization a spin on this website today. Here I write up how I did it, how it went, and what I think about it.
The proposed web monetization standard allows browsers to securely pay websites, and, in turn, allows for websites to react to being paid, for example by turning off ads or providing extra functionality to paying visitors. There is some good description of use cases on Coil&rsquo;s website if you&rsquo;re looking for a more general explainer.

      After a couple of years using ghost I switched to the static page generator hugo. Hugo is easy to write and easy to publish. But more importantly it doesn&rsquo;t offer the attack surface ghost does and doesn&rsquo;t require external ressources like ghost does. It further decreases the amount of ressources used on the server.
