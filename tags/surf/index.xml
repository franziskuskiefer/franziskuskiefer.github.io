      <description>Last week we had the third Security Engineering University Relationship Framework (SURF) summit in Vienna. The last SURF summit I attended was the first one in London 2018.
This time we had four talks by Mozillians, three invited talks, as well as eight lightning talks. I live-tweeted a little during the event if you like slides on photos.
Christoph talked about how to harden the content security landscape of Firefox and posed the question how we could do some of that on the web.</description>

      <description>The Security Engineering University Relationship Framework (SURF) is an initiative within the Firefox security engineering team to improve relations with privacy and security researchers. SURF includes a variety of possible relationships but is focused on building long-term relationships with researchers and organisations. The goal of SURF projects is to explore topics that are outside of Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s immediate product needs, influence Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s long-term product development and vision.
On November 12th the first SURF summit was held in London.</description>
