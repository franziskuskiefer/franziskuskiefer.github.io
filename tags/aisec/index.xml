After not even half a year I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Fraunhofer AISEC&lt;/a> at the end of May.
In this post I want to explain why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This is not a post about contact tracing!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the week of April 13 the controversy around &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.pepp-pt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>PEPP-PT&lt;/a> started to heat up. Articles from &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-protocol-removed-from-eu-contact-tracing-website-with-no-notice" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>coindesk&lt;/a> and other media such as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.golem.de/news/pepp-pt-streit-beim-corona-app-projekt-2004-147925.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Golem&lt;/a> (German), started to pop up and I started to get a little concerned knowing that AISEC is part of the PEPP-PT organization.
This quickly changed from being a sensible thing done by some people in the organization that employs me to something pretty sketchy that I definitely wanted to learn more about.
Note that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been involved in any of the contact tracing approaches at AISEC or anywhere else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were three separate points that concerned me.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Everything I have seen pointed to an approach to contact tracing that has huge potential to being abused. An approach that needs careful consideration and maybe shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used in the first place. But without knowing any details I could hardly tell if this was really the case.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The way PEPP-PT and AISEC communicated not only with the public but, as it appeared, also with other members of the consortium and employees, didn&amp;rsquo;t seem compatible with my understanding of responsible science, which requires an open discussion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This situation started to shed a bad light on everyone working for AISEC who&amp;rsquo;s taking privacy and open communication on such an important topic seriously.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In order to be able to judge the situation a little better and potentially help the necessary discussion around privacy in contact tracing apps I decided to reply to the only e-mail I had on the topic.
This was before anything was published by PEPP-PT or AISEC.
On April 1st when PEPP-PT was launched the AISEC director Claudia Eckert sent out an e-mail informing everyone that &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de/de/presse-und-veranstaltungen/presse/pressemitteilungen/2020/PEPP-PT.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>AISEC was part of PEPP-PT&lt;/a> (press release from AISEC on that day in German).
I noted that the optics were pretty bad and other institutions such as ETH ZÃ¼rich left PEPP-PT. In particular, I wanted to know&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>in which way AISEC is involved in PEPP-PT and how the future collaboration is supposed to look like;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>how the institute wants to ensure that the situation doesn&amp;rsquo;t deteriorate any further (prevent further loss in credibility);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>when specifications, security models, and code would be published.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get involved in any (public) discussion before knowing what&amp;rsquo;s going on.
Asking internally, the person who should know, seemed like the obvious way to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The response was a little disappointing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t disclose any content of internal e-mails.
But the last sentence said that I&amp;rsquo;m of course free to hand in my notice and leave AISEC at any time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m doing.
I leave.
This is not an organization I want to work for.
Neither does the behavior of AISEC as part of PEPP-PT reflect my understanding of research, science, and social responsibility, nor does the response of the AISEC leadership demonstrate an environment in which I want to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(While I got a half-hearted explanation relayed a week later that tried to explain the e-mail with stress and the influx of many hostile e-mails, I believe that it is a symptom of a disrespectful culture within the organization.
Actually, I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard from Claudia Eckert since that e-mail.)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>So if you are interested in hiring me, send me an e-mail (mail@ this domain).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
